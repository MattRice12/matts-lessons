## About

This app is aimed towards creating simple, short lessons and exercises for the general public to learn web development from the ground up.

The idea is to lower the barrier of entry by minimizing jargon and presenting content in tiny bite-sized chunks.

The lessons are designed so a person can get through a couple with their morning coffee.

The exercises will be of a variety of sorts. Many will focus on the specific lesson, built to work on this particular concept. Others will be larger and cumulative.
